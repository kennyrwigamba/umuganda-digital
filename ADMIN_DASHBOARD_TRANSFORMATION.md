# Admin Dashboard Transformation - Complete

## What We've Accomplished

### 1. **Dynamic Data Integration**

- ✅ Transformed static admin dashboard to use real database data
- ✅ Implemented sector-level management for admins
- ✅ Added session-based authentication and role checking

### 2. **Key Features Implemented**

#### **Dashboard Statistics (Real-time)**

- **Total Residents**: Shows count of active residents in admin's sector
- **New Residents**: Monthly growth tracking
- **Attendance Rate**: Latest Umuganda session attendance percentage
- **Unpaid Fines**: Total amount and number of residents with outstanding fines
- **Next Umuganda**: Upcoming event information

#### **Data Tables (Dynamic)**

- **Recent Residents**: Latest 5 residents in the sector with status indicators
- **Outstanding Fines**: Top 5 unpaid fines with amount and reason

#### **Charts (Data-driven)**

- **Attendance Trends**: 6-month attendance rate line chart
- **Fines Distribution**: Doughnut chart showing fines by type

### 3. **Sector-Level Management**

- Admins can only see and manage residents within their assigned sector
- All queries are filtered by admin's sector
- Supports hierarchical management (sector → cells)

### 4. **Security & Authentication**

- Session-based authentication
- Role-based access control (admin vs resident)
- Proper error handling and fallbacks

### 5. **Database Schema Support**

The dashboard works with the existing schema:

- `users` table for residents and admins
- `attendance` table for tracking participation
- `fines` table for penalties
- `umuganda_events` table for events
- Location hierarchy (province → district → sector → cell)
