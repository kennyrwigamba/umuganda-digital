# Admin Dashboard - Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed

**Error**: `Fatal error: Uncaught Error: Class "LocationManager" not found`

## Root Cause

The AdminManager class was trying to instantiate LocationManager, but:

1. LocationManager wasn't included in the admin dashboard
2. AdminManager wasn't actually needed for the current dashboard functionality

## Solution Applied

### 1. Removed Unnecessary Dependencies

- Removed AdminManager import (not currently used)
- Removed LocationManager import (not needed)
- Simplified the model initialization

### 2. Fixed Database Initialization

**Before (Incorrect)**:

```php
$database = new Database();
$connection = $database->getConnection();
global $db;
$db = $connection;  // Wrong: $db should be Database instance, not mysqli
```

**After (Correct)**:

```php
require_once __DIR__ . '/../../../config/db.php';
global $db;  // Use the global Database instance created in db.php
$connection = $db->getConnection();  // Get mysqli connection for direct queries
```

### 3. Why This Works

- `config/db.php` creates a global `$db = new Database()` instance
- Models expect this global `$db` (Database instance) to be available
- Direct SQL queries need the mysqli `$connection` object
- This approach matches how other parts of the application work

## Current Dashboard Features âœ…

- **Authentication**: Session-based admin authentication
- **Dynamic Stats**: Real database-driven statistics
- **Sector Management**: Admin sees only their sector's data
- **Charts**: Data-driven attendance and fines charts
- **Tables**: Dynamic recent residents and outstanding fines
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for missing data

## Files Modified

1. `public/dashboard/admin/index.php` - Fixed database initialization
2. `test_admin_dashboard.php` - Updated test to match correct pattern

## Next Steps

- Dashboard is now fully functional
- Can be extended with AdminManager when needed for sector assignment features
- All database queries are working with proper sector filtering
