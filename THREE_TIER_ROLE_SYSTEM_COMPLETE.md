# Three-Tier Role System Implementation Complete

## ✅ What We've Successfully Implemented

### 1. **Database Schema Updates**

- **Updated Role Enum**: Modified `users` table to support three roles: `superadmin`, `admin`, `resident`
- **Created Superadmin Accounts**:
  - Default superadmin: `super@umuganda.rw` / `super123`
  - Upgraded existing admin (ID: 1) to superadmin role
- **Maintained Data Integrity**: All existing assignments and relationships preserved

### 2. **Authentication System Updates**

- **Updated Login Redirects**: Fixed `login.php` to properly redirect superadmins to their dashboard
- **Enhanced AuthController**: Already supports three-tier redirects:
  - `superadmin` → `/dashboard/superadmin/index.php`
  - `admin` → `/dashboard/admin/index.php`
  - `resident` → `/dashboard/resident/index.php`
- **Proper Role Checking**: Admin dashboard now accepts both `admin` and `superadmin` roles

### 3. **Superadmin Dashboard Features**

- **Dedicated Dashboard**: You already have `/dashboard/superadmin/` with full admin functionality
- **Admin Assignment Management**: New page `admin-assignments.php` allows superadmins to:
  - View all current admin-to-sector assignments
  - Assign unassigned admins to specific sectors
  - Remove existing assignments
  - See statistics (total admins, assigned/unassigned counts)

### 4. **Admin Assignment Workflow**

**For Superadmins:**

1. Login to superadmin dashboard
2. Navigate to "Admin Assignments"
3. Select an unassigned admin from dropdown
4. Choose a sector to assign them to
5. Submit assignment

**For Regular Admins:**

- Can only access their assigned sector's data
- Sector-level filtering automatically applied
- No access to superadmin features

### 5. **Current User Hierarchy**

#### **Superadmins (👑)**: 2 accounts

- `super@umuganda.rw` / `super123` (new default)
- `admin@example.com` / `admin123` (upgraded from admin)
- **Permissions**: Full system access, manage admin assignments, all sectors

#### **Admins (🛡️)**: 3 accounts

- `admin.gasabo@umuganda.rw` / `admin123` (assigned to Kimironko)
- `admin.nyarugenge@umuganda.rw` / `admin123` (assigned to Kimisagara)
- One unassigned admin available for assignment
- **Permissions**: Sector-specific management only

#### **Residents (👤)**: 16 accounts

- Test accounts across different sectors
- **Permissions**: View personal data, attendance, fines

## 🚀 How the System Works

### **Login Flow:**

1. **User logs in** → System checks role
2. **Superadmin** → Redirected to `/dashboard/superadmin/`
3. **Admin** → Redirected to `/dashboard/admin/` (shows only their sector data)
4. **Resident** → Redirected to `/dashboard/resident/`

### **Admin Assignment Flow:**

1. **Superadmin** assigns admin to sector via Admin Assignments page
2. **Database** stores assignment in `admin_assignments` table
3. **Admin login** → System queries assigned sector
4. **Dashboard** shows only data for assigned sector

### **Data Filtering:**

- **Admins** see only residents, attendance, fines from their assigned sector
- **Superadmins** can see all data across all sectors
- **Residents** see only their personal data
