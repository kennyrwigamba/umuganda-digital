### 3. **JavaScript Enhancements**

### 6. **Database Requirements**

**Tables Used:**

- `notices`: Main notices storage
- `notice_reads`: Tracks which users read which notices
- `users`: User location data for targeting

**Sample Data Created:**

- 13 sample notices with various types and priorities
- Sample read records for testing
- Different priority levels (critical, high, medium, low)
- Various notice types (urgent, event, general)

## Key Benefits of Dynamic Implementation

1. **Personalized Content**: Each user sees notices relevant to their location
2. **Read Tracking**: Users can track which notices they've read
3. **Priority System**: Urgent notices are prominently displayed
4. **Search & Filter**: Easy content discovery
5. **Real-time Updates**: AJAX-based interactions without page refresh
6. **Scalable**: Can handle large numbers of notices efficiently
7. **Admin-Friendly**: Notices are managed through database, not hard-coded

## Testing the Implementation

1. **Insert sample data**: Run `sample_notices_data.sql`
2. **Test filtering**: Use filter buttons to see type-specific notices
3. **Test search**: Search for keywords in notice content
4. **Test read functionality**: Click "Mark as Read" buttons
5. **Test responsive design**: Check mobile vs desktop views
6. **Test empty states**: Clear all notices to see empty state
